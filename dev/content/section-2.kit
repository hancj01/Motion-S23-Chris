        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>As Korean immigrants who came to the United States with a passion for sharing the unique flavors of Korean
            pastries, we established our family-owned Korean bakery in 2004. Using only the finest ingredients and
            traditional baking techniques, we create delicious and visually stunning treats such as red bean buns and
            milk bread. We invite you to visit our bakery and experience the taste of Korea right here in the United
            States.</p>
